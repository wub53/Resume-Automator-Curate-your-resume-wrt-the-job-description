PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Full Stack Software Engineer (MERN Stack, LLM Optimization)                    TargetArc, NJ, USA 07/2023 - Present
• Lead the end-to-end development of the Product namely Prompt Manager using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js,
    React, Node.js) stack, highlighting strong experience in both front-end and back-end technologies
• Took charge of resolving critical containerization and Docker environment issues, providing reliable support to the
    software development team, ensuring seamless project execution
• Successfully designed and implemented over 15+ end-to-end features, orchestrating data flow from the database to
    rendering on webpages, ensuring data consistency and scalability
• Developed an "Evaluate" feature leveraging the GPT-4 model to generate contextually similar suggestions for input
    prompts. This feature not only enhances the quality of output generation but also assesses the context strength and
    emotional tone of both suggestions and original prompts
• Implemented a "Run" feature, which efficiently interfaces with the GPT-4 model via API calls. This feature inputs
    user prompts to the GPT-4 model and displays its intelligent, context-aware responses
• Advanced the search functionality of our application by implementing a feature based on the Retrieval-Augmented
    Generation (RAG) methodology
Software Engineer (OpenCV, C++)                         Prescient Technologies, Pune MH/India 04/2021 - 07/2022
• Collaborated in R & D team for development of a client-based Object Detection and Tracking Application
• Achieved a test accuracy of 93% by training a Face Recognition model with VGG-16 architecture
• Proposed best architecture suited for model by collating and analyzing data from 15 + research papers
• Integrated above model in Object Detection and Tracking application
• Deployed the model using a separate self-written end to end pipeline flow

ACADEMIC / FREELANCE PROJECTS
Neural Network Modeler + Trainer (Python)                     Stevens Institute of Technology 03/2023 – 05/2023
• Created a lightweight Python framework that allows users to create, and train customized neural networks
• The framework is scalable to build and train large neural network models without compromising stability
• Provided flexibility for users to customize various hyper-parameters, such as the learning rate, the number of
    epochs, batch size etc. Incorporates core algorithms to implement both forward and back-propagation
• The framework supports visualization of the neural net and its loss evaluation along with dataset visualization
Generative Bi-gram Language model (Python)                      Stevens Institute of Technology 09/2022 – 10/2022
• Developed a custom transformer architecture “block by block” from the ground up using PyTorch’s tensor
    manipulations and neural network development API functions
• Demonstrated proficiency in model composition and integration by integrating this architecture into a bigram LM
Stevens SmartQuery: AI-Enhanced FAQ Assistant                   Stevens Institute of Technology 09/2022 – 12/2022
• Lead the creation of an AI FAQ Chatbot at Stevens using the RAG framework and Large Language Models
• This chatbot transforms the website experience by offering instant, context-aware natural language response to
    user queries, leveraging a comprehensive and proprietary FAQ dataset of the university
